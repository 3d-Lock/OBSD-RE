Welcome, to the first chapter of the OBSD-RE Challenge.

You broke into a laboratory building and are standing in front of a computer that is running a program.
The program requires a username and password.


Try to get the username and password using the reverse engineering technique.
and login.....

You will see the further steps after you have successfully logged in.


Good Luck!
